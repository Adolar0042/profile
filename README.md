## Applying a profile

```toml
[profiles.default]
user.name = "Your Name"
user.email = "your_name@personal.example.com"

[profiles.company]
user.name = "Your Name (ACME Inc.)"
user.email = "your_name@company.example.com"

[[rules]]
profile.name = "company"
owner = "acme" # Applies company profiles to all repositories in `acme` org

[[rules]]
profile.name = "default"
```

Then, apply a profile:

```sh
profile apply default
# or
profile apply company
# or this to apply the profile based on rules
profile apply
```
